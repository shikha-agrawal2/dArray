//only difference between protected and default access modifier is that the sub class of different package cannot access
// default method. ... The protected specifier allows access by all subclasses
// of the class in a program, whatever package they reside in, as well as to other code in the same package.

//foo() is protected in Base and default in Derived. Default access is more restrictive. When a derived class
// overrides a base class function, more restrictive access canâ€™t be given to the overridden function.
