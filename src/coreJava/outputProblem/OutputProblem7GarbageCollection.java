//Explanation : We know that finalize() method is called by Garbage Collector on an object before destroying it.
// But here, the trick is that the str is String class object, not the Test class. Therefore, finalize() method
// of String class(if overridden in String class) is called on str.
// If a class doesnâ€™t override finalize method, then by default Object class finalize() method is called.
